# KATTABOZOR_Test

Project Description:

This open-source Android application showcases the power of modern Android app development by utilizing a combination of cutting-edge technologies. The project embraces Retrofit, Dagger-Hilt, Jetpack Compose, and follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern.

Key Features:

Retrofit Integration: The application demonstrates how to integrate Retrofit, a popular HTTP client for Android, to fetch data from a remote server. Retrofit simplifies network requests and data retrieval, making it an integral part of this project.

Dagger-Hilt Dependency Injection: Dagger-Hilt, a powerful dependency injection framework, is utilized to manage and provide dependencies across the app. It ensures clean and maintainable code by facilitating the separation of concerns and easy testing.

Jetpack Compose UI: The user interface is built using Jetpack Compose, Google's modern UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces. Compose offers a declarative way to design UI components, enhancing the app's aesthetics and user experience.

MVVM Architecture: The project follows the MVVM architectural pattern, separating the app into Model, View, and ViewModel components. This ensures code modularity, testability, and maintainability.
